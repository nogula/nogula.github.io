        <h1>Biscuits and Gravy</h1>
        <p>Biscuits are based on <a href="https://altonbrown.com/recipes/southern-buttermilk-biscuits/">Alton Brown's recipe</a>. My brother Josh made this for breakfast at my bachelor party and apparently it left a greater impression on everyone than the pulled pork or barbacoa tacos. So must be pretty good.</p>
        <h2>Biscuits</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 c + 6 tbls flour, plus 1/2 c for dusting</li>
            <li>5 tsp baking powder</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp baking soda</li>
            <li>3/4 tsp salt</li>
            <li>1/3 c leaf lard, chilled</li>
            <li>2 tbls butter, sliced thin and chilled</li>
            <li>1 c low-fat buttermilk, chilled</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Recipe</h2>
        <p>Heat oven to 450°.</p>
        <p>Sift flour, baking powder, soda, salt. Work quickly and use your digits to rub the lard and butter into the dry mixture. Should turn out as coarse crumbs.</p>
        <p>Make a well in the center and add buttermilk. Stir with a wooden spoon until the dough just starts to come together (should be very sticky). Leave in the bowl and fold the dough to pick up remaining flour, then turn on to floured work surface.</p>
        <p>Dust the top and gently fold dough 8 more times, turning one quarter between each motion. Press dough to 1-inch-thk. Cut out biscuits at 2-1/2". Don't twist. Flour the cutter between cuts.</p>
        <p>Biscuits on baking sheet, shoulder-to-shoulder.</p>
        <p>Bake 10 mins. Rotate 180 deg and bake 8-12 mins more till done.</p>
        <h2>Gravy</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>sausage gravy ingredients</li>
            <li>seasoning</li>
            <li>paprika</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Recipe</h3>
