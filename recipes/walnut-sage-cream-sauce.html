        <h1>Walnut Cream Sage Sauce</h1>
        <p>Natalie and I learned how to make this at a Sur La Table cooking class. It was served with spinach linguini alongside crispy prosciutto.</p>
        <p><emph>Note:</emph>Ratios are actually pretty important for this one. Makes ennough for 4 large servings.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 c walnut halves</li>
            <li>1 c heavy cream</li>
            <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1/4 c parmesean + more to serve</li>
            <li>2 sage leaves</li>
            <li>parsley, S&P</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Recipe</h2>
        <p>Roast walnuts for 10 mins at 375°. Add half the nuts to the cream, sage, garlic, S&P, cheese in a food processor. Make it smooth.</p>
        <p>Put the sauce into a large bowl. Add pasta and toss until coated. Add pasta water to thin the sauce.</p>
