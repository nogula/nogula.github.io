        <h1>Mountain Men</h1>
        <p>This is a staple from my Boy Scout troop. There is no 'correct' way to cook this dish. It was so popular in scouts, particularly on Sunday mornings, because it only requires cleaning a dutch oven. And also it makes a lot of servings.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1-2 lbs ground sausage</li>
            <li>bag of frozen shredded hash browns</li>
            <li>onion</li>
            <li>peppers</li>
            <li>1 dozen eggs</li>
            <li>shredded cheese</li>
            <li>burrito-sized tortillas</li>
            <li>S&P</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Recipe</h2>
        <p>In a dutch oven, brown the sausage, sautee the onions and pepper. Stir in the hash browns and cover. Cook until everything is warmed up and cooked thoroughly. Add in the eggs, cook until the eggs are done. You don't really need to stir. Once eggs are cooked, add in the cheese and mix everything together.</p>
        <p>With the lid of the dutch oven, heat up tortillas. Add filling and eat while standing around the campfire while you wait for the courage and energy to start breaking down camp and packing up.</p>
