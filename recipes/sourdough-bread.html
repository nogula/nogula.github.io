        <p>Good luck! It is hard to maintain and very finicky. If you're up for the challenge, here it is.</p>

            <li>1 okg dry yeast</li>
            <li>1/2 c warm water (100-115°)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Heat the millk and add water and cool to luke warm. Stir in sugar, salt, flour, and beat. Pour into a large bowl (allow for expansion), cover with cheese cloth and allow to stand 3-5 days in a warm spot, until mixture is bubbly and has a sour aroma. Dissolve yeast in 1/2 c water and mix into starter. Cover and stir down each day for a week.</p>
        <h2>Sponge</h2>

        <p>Several hours before, prepare the sponge and allow to rise to double.</p>
        <p>Dissolve dry yeast in 1/2 c water and add to sponge. Add 1 c flour mix and turn onto board. Knead in additional flower to make a stiff dough.</p>
