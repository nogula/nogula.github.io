        <h1>Focaccia</h1>
        <p>This bread can be used for sandwiches (I like to put pulled pork on it), for pasta, or whatever else.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>500 mL luke warm water</li>
            <li>1 pkt yeast</li>
            <li>~700 g #00 flour</li>
            <li>1 tsp sugar</li>
            <li>S&P, garlic powder, olive oil</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Recipe</h2>
        <p>Stir yeast, sugar into water. Let sit for 5 mins or until the yeast blooms. If it doesn't, that means the yeast is bad.</p>
        <p>Pour flour until it becomes hard to stir with just a wooden spoon. Put a damp towel over the bowl and let it sit for 15 minutes. Add in more flour again until you can't easily stir with the spoon.</p>
        <p>Leave spoon in, cover with towel, and let it rise for 2 hrs. Then, gently deflate with the spoon and knead it.</p>
        <p>Repeat above 2-4 times.</p>
        <p>Coat outside of dough with olive oil, tightly cover in plastic wrap, refigerate. Optionally divide dough ahead.</p>
        <p>Leave in fridge 3 hrs or 1 wk.</p>
        <p>When ready to cook, preheat oven for 20 mins at 500° with a stone in it. Gently remove dough from bowl, turn it upside down, add seasoning and more olive oil.</p>
        <p>Gently stretch dough onto stone directly in the oven. Cok 10 mins or until the top is golden. Let sit for another 10 mins to cool.</p>
