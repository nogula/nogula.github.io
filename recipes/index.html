        <h1>Recipes</h1>
        <p>Cooking has been a long standing tradition in my family, just as it has in many others. I have been cooking for as long as I can remember with my training from Boy Scouts and my father. Christmas of 2024, my father gave me a transcription of our family recipe book, which contains some new recipes and some which are very old. My grandfather started this tradition with my dad in 1991, who learned much of his culinary skills from his mother (my great grandma Gula). My mom also added many recipes, several of which are cookies. Other recipes are from my wife's family.</p>
        <p>The recipes contained herein are in no particular order. For the sake of chronicling the minutae, I will attempt to list which recipes came from whom/where and when.</p>
        <p>These web pages are a digital mirror of the physical recipe book. Some recipes are incomplete. At least one of the recipes is a decoy. I almost never cook the recipes as per the book, and never the same way twice. This is about cooking; no warranty is expressed or implied.</p>
