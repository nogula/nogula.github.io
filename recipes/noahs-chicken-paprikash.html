        <h1>Noah's Chicken Paprikash</h1>
        <p>The other chicken paprikash recipe is a decoy. This is the real deal. Big key is to use all fresh ingredients.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>chicken breasts - not too thick! With or without skin</li>
            <li>grape tomatoes (on a vine)</li>
            <li>roma tomatoes</li>
            <li>oil (high flame temp)</li>
            <li>paprika</li>
            <li>shallots + green onion</li>
            <li>garlic</li>
            <li>chicken broth</li>
            <li>sour cream</li>
            <li>red pepper flakes</li>
            <li>flour</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Recipe</h2>
        <p>Use an oven-safe skillet or frying pan (cast iron preferred). Fry chicken in oil, salt, pepper until cooked. Idea is to cook them hot and fast, not slow and stupid. If they are very thick, then bake in oven at 425° for 20 mins or until done. Once cooked, set chicken aside and reserve oil.</p>
        <p>Sautee shallots + green onion whites with garlic, paprika, salt/pepper, red pepper flakes. You probably need more paprika than you think.</p>
        <p>Add in chicken broth and cook down for a while.</p>
        <p>Slice and dice tomatoes and add to skillet. Optionally add before broth.</p>
        <p>Add flour to thicken.</p>
        <p>Add chicken back in.</p>
        <p>Blast it under broiler for a few minutes.</p>
        <p>Let cool for a few minutes, then add a few scoops of sour cream, stirring constantly.</p>
