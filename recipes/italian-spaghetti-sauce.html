        <h1>Italian Spaghetti Sauce</h1>
        <p>This recipe is from my dad. It is the red sauce used to make shrimp + cream sauce, which his friend Brad renamed "Shrimp w/ Aaron Sauce."</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1-2 lbs country spare ribs</li>
            <li>(1) 28 oz can tomator puree</li>
            <li>(1) 12 oz can tomator paste</li>
            <li>6 oz red wine</li>
            <li>2-3 bay leaves</li>
            <li>2 tbls oregano</li>
            <li>1 tbls basil</li>
            <li>1 onion</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic</li>
            <li>1 tbls sugar</li>
            <li>salt</li>
            <li>olive oil</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Recipe</h2>
        <p>Brown the country ribs in hot oil. Add everything else and cook for 2-3 hours. (Add water if too thick.)</p>
        <p>Remove the ribs and eat them!</p>
        <p>This is a very good basic italian sauce to use on its own, with meatballs, or as a base to go from!</p>
