            <li>hot pepper sausages</li>

            <li>wine of your choosing</li>
            <li>1 c tomato marinara sauce or sub 6 tomatoes</li>
            <li>rigatoni</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Recipe</h2>
        <p>Cook sausages at 425° until done. Put water in cast iron until finished, then cut into slices.</p>
        <p>Cut red pepper, onion, and basil.</p>
        <p>Put red pepper slices on soft side up with olive oil and cook with sausage until some burnt on sides.</p>
        <p>Sautee onions in pan while boiling pasta water. The sausages should be done at this point.</p>
        <p>Cook the rigatoni until al dente. Together in the cast iron, cook roasted red peppers, onions, marinara, heave cream, and half a glass of cabernet sauviogn together. Let bubble then put on a simmer and add roasted red pepper, seasoning, S&P.</p>
        <p>When the rigatoni is done, add about half a cup or a cup of pasta water into the sauce. Mix and let simmer. Meanwhile, cut basil and stir in a handful of shredded parmesean into dish on top of pasta and stir into the sauce.</p>
        <p>After about 5 mins, add another handful of sprinkling of sauce into mix on top of pasta for presentation.</p>
        <h3>For toast</h3>
        <p>Use your favorite bread and coat each side with butter. Set the oven to broil. Sprinkle as much cheese as desired on bread and place into the oven. Cook until desired.</p>
        <p>Serve and dip with pasta and enjoy! Love, Mama Natalie.</p>
