        <h1>French Bread</h1>
        <p>This is my dad's recipe, which I think is based on his dad's recipe. My dad would make this bread at most holidays. My brothers and I would always request it.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 c flour</li>

            <li>2 pkgs dry yeast</li>
            <li>2-1/4 cup hot tap water</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Recipe</h2>
        <p>Mix together the dry ingredients. Add the water and mix with a mixer. Add 2-3 more cups of flour until the mixer won't handle it anymore and begin using a spoon. Turn onto a board and knead in flour until smooth and elastic, slightly sticky.</p>
        <p>Let rise until double in size. Punch down & shape into 2 loaves.</p>
